**st.connection** makes it easy to write Streamlit apps with high quality data connections.
The feature includes:

- `st.connection()` factory method to initialize ready-to-use data connection objects
- Concrete implementations in Streamlit for a few key data sources:
  - SQL engines including Postgresql, MySQL, sqlite, MS SQL Server, Snowflake, Oracle, BigQuery, Redshift and
[more](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/dialects/index.html)
  - Cloud file storage including S3, GCS, ABS, FTP, HDFS, and [more](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#built-in-implementations)
  - Snowpark for Snowflake
- An extendable `BaseConnection` class to easily build (and share) new connection types!
